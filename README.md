# Sample Hardhat Project

Following the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ&t=42013s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org free code camp youtube course;

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
